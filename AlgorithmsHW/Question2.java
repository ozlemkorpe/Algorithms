/*
Given an unsorted array, the array has this property that
every element in array is at most k distance from its position
in sorted array where k is a positive integer smaller than
size of array. For example, let us consider k is 2, an element
at index 7 in the sorted array, can be at indexes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
in the given array. We can sort such arrays more efficiently 
with the help of Heap data structure. Implement the following
algorithm that uses a Heap: - Create a Min Heap of size k+1 with
first k+1 elements. - One by one remove min element from heap, 
put it in result array, and add a new element to heap from 
remaining elements.
